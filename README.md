### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Parsa.

I'm currently a PhD student at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne, Switzerland (EPFL).

My research is related to the intersection of three main lines of research: 1) human-computer interaction, 2) natural language processing and machine learning, and 3) digital education. I am passionate about modeling how individuals learn, as well as designing and developing educational tools and methods that can help people improve their abilities, and specifically, metacognitive skills.

I've authored or co-authored publications in the domain of AI and HCI in educational technologies, specifically in the venues of CHI, ACL, EMNLP, and AIED; a list of which can be found here: [https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=hZFxf-kAAAAJ&hl=en](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=hZFxf-kAAAAJ&hl=en)

I'm interested in collaboration on developing educational technologies which support individuals in their learning environments, as well as investigating best approaches to model how learners interact with the knowledge they receive within a pedagogical environment. If you have any interesting idea to share, feel free to contact me! My personal website: [http://spneshaei.com](http://spneshaei.com)
